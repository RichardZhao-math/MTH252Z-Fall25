  <title>Further Integral Formulas</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, you will undo even more derivative formulas you learned back in calculus 1 in terms of integrations.

          After this section, students will be able to:

      <ul>

          <p>
            integrate using integral formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Evaluate the indefinite integral <m> \displaystyle \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </m>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can we evaluate this integral using <m>u</m>-sub?

      </statement>

    <task>
      <p>
        Evaluate this integral using the hint given below. 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          This may seem like a totally irrelevant hint but what is the derivative of <me>y = \arcsin(x)</me> 
        </p>

        <note>
          <title>Clarifying the notation</title>
          <p>
            The function <m>y = \arcsin(x)</m> means the <alert>inverse</alert> sine of <m>x</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Another famous notation for inverse sine is <m>y = \sin^{-1}(x)</m>. 
            Be careful with this exponent of <m>-1</m>. 
            This doesn't mean the reciprocal of <m>\sin(x)</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I will use both notations interchangeably. 
          </p>
        </note>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Recall back in calculus 1, we learned about the derivative of inverse trigonometric function. 
          One of the formulas is
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\arcsin(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
          </me>
          In other words, we can rewrite the above formula using integration as follows: 
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx = \arcsin(x) + C
          </me>
          Hence, we can evaluate this integral as follows: 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\arcsin(x) + C </mrow>
          </md>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
  </investigation>

  <p>
    Recall we learned a couple formulas about taking the derivative of the inverse trigonometric functions back in calculus 1. 
    If we rewrite these formulas, we will obtain more formulas to help us evaluate integrals.

    <p>
      Back in calculus 1, you learned the derivative of the six inverse trigonometric functions. 
      Of course we can rewrite the six derivative formulas into the <alert>three</alert> integrals formulas in the following theorem. 
    </p>

          <md>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \amp\amp\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \amp\amp\int \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} = \tan^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sec^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \amp\amp\int \frac{dx}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} = \sec^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>

        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <title>Some Exercises for this section</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        I included some practice problems that cover some main concepts in this section. 
        You don't need to turn it in, but I highly encourage you to work on this with your classmates. 
        I may take problems here to be your in-class practice problems, homework problems, and/or exam problems. 
        Reach out to Richard for help if you get stuck or have any questions. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I will only include the final answer to some of the problems for you to check your result. 
        If you want to check your work, talk to Richard and he is happy to discuss the process with you.
