    <introduction>
      <p>
        Evaluate the indefinite integral <m> \displaystyle \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </m>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <p>
        Can we evaluate this integral using <m>u</m>-sub? 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          We can certainly try using <m>u</m>-sub and see if it will work out. 
          Recall <m>u</m>-sub undoes the chain rule for derivative, which is a method to differentiate a composite function. 
          Typically, <m>u</m> is some inside function in some composite function. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two choices of <m>u</m> as an inside function you can pick. Try them! Will they work out? If not, what seems to be the issue? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We cannot use <m>u</m>-sub here. There are two issues depending on what your choice of <m>u</m> is (but these issues are essentially the same). 
        </p>

        <p>
          If we pick <m>u = 1 - x^2</m>. Then <m>du = -2x\, dx</m>, which implies that <m>x\, dx = -\frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          But there is no factor of <m>x</m> in the integrand that allows us substitute <m>x\, dx</m> with <m>-\frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          So we will get stuck here... 
        </p>

        <p>
          A possible solution to resolve this issue is to isolate <m>dx</m> entirely by dividing the <m>x</m> to the other side (and pretending <m>x</m> can never be zero). 
          This implies that <m>dx = \frac{du}{-2x}</m>. 
          By this substitution, we obtain
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx = \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}\cdot \frac{du}{-2x}
          </me>
          Okay... but there is still an <m>x</m> in the integrand. This is super confusing since the variable we are dealing with now is <m>u</m>. 
          Given our substitution that <m>u = 1 - x^2</m>, we see that <m>x = \sqrt{1 - u}</m>. 
          Then the integral becomes
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}\cdot \frac{du}{-2\sqrt{1 - u}} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= -\frac{1}{4}\int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u}\sqrt{1 - u}} </mrow>
          </md>
          Omg... the work is much much much more complicated... 
          If you want to continue with this line of work, the next step should be making another <m>u</m>-sub by letting <m>w = \sqrt{u}</m>. 
          This should loop you back to the same(ish) integral. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Another choice of <m>u</m> is <m>u = \sqrt{1 - x^2}</m>. 
          Then <m>du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\cdot -2x\, dx</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>
      
    </task>

    <task>
      <p>
        Evaluate this integral using the hint given below. 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          This may seem like a totally irrelevant hint but what is the derivative of <me>y = \arcsin(x)</me> 
        </p>

        <note>
          <title>Clarifying the notation</title>
          <p>
            The function <m>y = \arcsin(x)</m> means the <alert>inverse</alert> sine of <m>x</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Another famous notation for inverse sine is <m>y = \sin^{-1}(x)</m>. 
            Be careful with this exponent of <m>-1</m>. 
            This doesn't mean the reciprocal of <m>\sin(x)</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I will use both notations interchangeably. 
          </p>
        </note>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Recall back in calculus 1, we learned about the derivative of inverse trigonometric function. 
          One of the formulas is
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\arcsin(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
          </me>
          In other words, we can rewrite the above formula using integration as follows: 
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx = \arcsin(x) + C
          </me>
          Hence, we can evaluate this integral as follows: 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\arcsin(x) + C </mrow>
          </md>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
  </investigation>

  <p>
    Recall we learned a couple formulas about taking the derivative of the inverse trigonometric functions back in calculus 1. 
    If we rewrite these formulas, we will obtain more formulas to help us evaluate integrals.

    <title>Integral formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions</title>

    <p>
      Back in calculus 1, you learned the derivative of the six inverse trigonometric functions. 
      Of course we can rewrite the six derivative formulas into the <alert>three</alert> integrals formulas in the following theorem. 
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-IntegralInvolvingInverseTrig">
      <title>Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} = \tan^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sec^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} = \sec^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <note>
      <title>Why do we only rewrite three of the six derivative formulas? </title>
      
      <p>
        
      </p>
      
    </note>

    <example>
      
      <p>
        Evaluate the indefinite integral <m>\displaystyle \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx</m>
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          The bad news here is that we cannot simplify the fraction (there is nothing we can cancel here)...  
        </p>

        <p>
          You may try using <m>u</m>-sub and it will work out if you use it smartly. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is Richard's hint: before using <m>u</m>-sub, try splitting up the fraction as follows: 
          <me>
            \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2}
          </me>
          Do we know how to integrate each term? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Using Richard's hint and linearity, we know that
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int\left(\frac{1}{1 + x^2} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\right)\, dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx + \int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Observe that there is a formula in <xref ref="thm-IntegralInvolvingInverseTrig"/> we can use directly to evaluate the first integral. 
          Hence, the first integral can be evaluated as follows: 
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \arctan(x) + C_1 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          For the second integral, we can evaluate it using <m>u</m>-sub. 
          Let <m>u = 1 + x^2</m>. Then <m>du = 2x\, dx</m>, and hence <m>x\, dx = \frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          This implies that
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int\frac{\frac{du}{2}}{u} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{du}{u} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C_2 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(1 + x^2\right) + C_2 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Putting these two pieces together, we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx + \int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \arctan(x) + \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(1 + x^2\right) + C </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      One thing you may notice from the previous example is that 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Evaluate the definite integral <m>\displaystyle \int_0^\frac{3}{2} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{9 - 4x^2}}</m>
      </p>
      
      <hint>
