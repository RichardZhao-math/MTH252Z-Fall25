  <title>Further Integral Formulas</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, you will undo even more derivative formulas you learned back in calculus 1 in terms of integrations.

          After this section, students will be able to:

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Evaluate the indefinite integral <m> \displaystyle \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </m>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <p>
        Can we evaluate this integral using <m>u</m>-sub? 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          We can certainly try using <m>u</m>-sub and see if it will work out. 
          Recall <m>u</m>-sub undoes the chain rule for derivative, which is a method to differentiate a composite function. 
          Typically, <m>u</m> is some inside function in some composite function. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two choices of <m>u</m> as an inside function you can pick. Try them! Will they work out? If not, what seems to be the issue? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <title>Choice #1: Let <m>u = 1 - x^2</m></title>

        <p>
          We cannot use <m>u</m>-sub here. There are many issues that needs to be resolved in order to make progress... 
          And
        
        </p>

        <p>
          If we pick <m>u = 1 - x^2</m>. Then <m>du = -2x\, dx</m>, which implies that <m>x\, dx = -\frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          But there is no factor of <m>x</m> in the integrand that allows us substitute <m>x\, dx</m> with <m>-\frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          So we will get stuck here... 
        </p>

        <p>
          A possible way to resolve this issue is to isolate the <m>dx</m> entirely by dividing the <m>x</m> to the other side (and pretending <m>x</m> can never be zero). 
          This implies that <m>dx = \frac{du}{-2x}</m>. 
          By this substitution, we obtain
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx = \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}\cdot \frac{du}{-2x}
          </me>
          Okay... but there is still an <m>x</m> in the integrand. 
          This is super confusing since the variable we are dealing with now is <m>u</m>, not <m>x</m>. 
          Given our substitution that <m>u = 1 - x^2</m>, we see that <m>x = \sqrt{1 - u}</m>. 
          Then the integral becomes
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}\cdot \frac{du}{-2\sqrt{1 - u}} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= -\frac{1}{4}\int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u}\sqrt{1 - u}} </mrow>
          </md>
          Wow... the integral doesn't get easier after all this hard work... 
          <alert> This should be an indicator to search for another method to evaluate this integral</alert>. 
          <m>u</m>-sub should make the integral <em>easier</em> to deal with, not harder. 
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are feeling a bit adventurous and want to continue with this line of work (to see if it will work out eventually), the next step will be to make another substitution by letting <m>w = \sqrt{u}</m>. 
          Then <m>dw = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}</m> and <m>u = w^2 </m>. 
          Then we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow> -\frac{1}{4}\int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u}\sqrt{1 - u}} \amp= -\frac{1}{4}\int \frac{2\, dw}{\sqrt{1 - w^2}} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= -\frac{1}{2}\int \frac{dw}{\sqrt{1 - w^2}} </mrow>
          </md>
          Observe that this integral is almost the same as the integral given in the prompt, which means we looped back to the problem after all the hard work... 
          Another way of saying this is that this method is inconclusive... 
        </p>

      </solution>

      <solution>
        <title>Choice #2: Let <m>u = \sqrt{1 - x^2}</m></title>
        
        <p>
          Richard can tell right ahead that this choice of <m>u</m> is also inconclusive (it will loop you back to the problem as well) due to his awesome math skills. 
          But just in case he didn't lose his mind, he will present the work (and also convince himself that he is still young and he can do the math in his head). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>u = \sqrt{1 - x^2}</m>. 
          Then <m>du = \dfrac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx</m>, which implies that
          <me>
            dx = \frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{-x}\, du = \frac{u}{-\sqrt{1 - u^2}}\, du
          </me>
          We obtain
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2u}\cdot \frac{u}{-\sqrt{1 - u^2}}\, du </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= -\int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - u^2}}\, du </mrow>
          </md>
          Observe that this integral is (again) almost the same as the integral given in the prompt.
          We (again) looped back back to the problem after the hard work...  
        </p>
      </solution>
      
    </task>

    <task>
      <p>
        Evaluate this integral <em>not</em> using <m>u</m>-sub, but using the hint given below. 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          This may seem like a totally irrelevant hint but what is the derivative of <me>y = \arcsin(x)</me> 
          You learned this back in calculus 1 so feel free to look up your notes. 
        </p>

        <note>
          <title>Clarifying the notation</title>
          <p>
            The function <m>y = \arcsin(x)</m> means the <alert>inverse</alert> sine of <m>x</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Another famous notation for inverse sine is <m>y = \sin^{-1}(x)</m>. 
            Be careful with this exponent of <m>-1</m>. 
            This doesn't mean the reciprocal of <m>\sin(x)</m>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I will use both notations interchangeably. 
          </p>
        </note>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Recall back in calculus 1, we learned about the derivative of inverse trigonometric function. 
          One of the formulas is
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\arcsin(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
          </me>
          In other words, we can rewrite the above formula using integration as follows: 
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx = \arcsin(x) + C
          </me>
          Hence, we can evaluate this integral as follows: 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\arcsin(x) + C </mrow>
          </md>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
  </investigation>

  <p>
    Recall we learned a couple formulas about taking the derivative of the inverse trigonometric functions back in calculus 1. 
    If we rewrite these formulas, we will obtain more formulas to help us evaluate integrals.

    <title>Integral formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions</title>

    <p>
      Back in calculus 1, you learned the derivative of the six inverse trigonometric functions. 
      Of course we can rewrite the six derivative formulas into the <alert>three</alert> integrals formulas in the following theorem. 
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-IntegralInvolvingInverseTrig">
      <title>Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
      
      <p></p>

        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} = \tan^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sec^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \amp\amp\implies \qquad \int \frac{dx}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} = \sec^{-1}(x) + C </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <note>
      <title>Why do we only rewrite three of the six derivative formulas? </title>
      
      <p>
        
      </p>
      
    </note>

    <example>
      
      <p>
        Evaluate the indefinite integral <m>\displaystyle \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx</m>
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          The bad news here is that we cannot simplify the fraction (there is nothing we can cancel here)...  
        </p>

        <p>
          You may try using <m>u</m>-sub and it will work out if you use it smartly. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is Richard's hint: before using <m>u</m>-sub, try splitting up the fraction as follows: 
          <me>
            \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2}
          </me>
          Do we know how to integrate each term? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Using Richard's hint and linearity, we know that
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int\left(\frac{1}{1 + x^2} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\right)\, dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx + \int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Observe that there is a formula in <xref ref="thm-IntegralInvolvingInverseTrig"/> we can use directly to evaluate the first integral. 
          Hence, the first integral can be evaluated as follows: 
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \arctan(x) + C_1 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          For the second integral, we can evaluate it using <m>u</m>-sub. 
          Let <m>u = 1 + x^2</m>. Then <m>du = 2x\, dx</m>, and hence <m>x\, dx = \frac{du}{2}</m>. 
          This implies that
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int\frac{\frac{du}{2}}{u} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{du}{u} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C_2 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(1 + x^2\right) + C_2 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Putting these two pieces together, we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{1 + x}{1 + x^2}\, dx \amp= \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\, dx + \int \frac{x}{1 + x^2}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \arctan(x) + \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(1 + x^2\right) + C </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      One thing you may notice from the previous example is that 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Evaluate the definite integral <m>\displaystyle \int_0^\frac{3}{2} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{9 - 4x^2}}</m>
      </p>
      
      <hint>
