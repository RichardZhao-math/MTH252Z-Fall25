        <p>
            You are encouraged to work on this assignment collaboratively with your peers in class. 
            You can also ask Richard for hints if you are stuck. 
            Yet, you should write up your own work and submit it on Canvas in <alert>one single PDF file</alert>. 
            Show all of your work for full credits, and your work should be clearly written and organized. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The written homework #2 is due on <alert>October 19, 2025</alert>.

                                A trigonometric identity you may find helpful here is

                                This is more like a checking point. What is <m>(x - 1)^3</m>?

                                Richard can tell you right now that exponents do not distribute across the sum/difference, so 
                                <me>
                                    (x - 1)^3 \neq x^3 - 1^3

                Wind engineers have found that wind speed <m>v</m> (in m/s) at a given location follows a <alert>Rayleigh distribution</alert> of the type 
                <me>
                    W(v) = \frac{1}{32}ve^{-v^2/64}
                </me>
                This  means that at a given moment in time, the probability that <m>v</m> lies between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is equal to the <em>shaded area</em> in the figure below.
