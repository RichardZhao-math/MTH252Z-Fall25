    <title>Structure of the Integral</title>

    <p>
      The investigation tasks in this section will ask you to think about integrals in a different way. 
      Recall the two major ways you think about integrals so far are: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some signed area under the curve, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some general antiderivative of the integrand, plug some numbers in, and do the subtraction. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Well it turns out that neither of them are the <alert>actual</alert> meaning of integrals. 
      The area aspect is a <alert>graphical</alert> interpretation of integrals and the antiderivative is just one <alert>method</alert> to evaluate integrals, guaranteed by the FTC. 
      These two approaches are limited when applying integrals to real-world problems since (1) we don't always have a graph to work with, and (2) not all functions will have a nice antiderivatives we can work with.

      <title>The Great Gorilla Jump</title>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Imagine this: a gorilla, suited up with a parachute, climbs to the top of a tall city building as part of a special wildlife training experiment. 
          After a brief moment of hesitation, the gorilla bravely leaps off the edge. 
          As the parachute deploys and air resistance kicks in, you, as one of the researchers on the ground, begin recording data to study how the gorilla's velocity changes over time.
          Using high-speed sensors, the team records the gorillaâ€™s downward velocity every half-second as it falls. 
          Note that the gorilla touched the ground just after 5 seconds. 
          The recorded data is shown below.
