                You are encouraged to work on this assignment collaboratively with your peers in class. 
                You can also ask Richard for hints if you are stuck. 
                Yet, you should write up your own work and submit it on Canvas in <alert>one single PDF file</alert>. 
                Show all of your work for full credits, and your work should be clearly written and organized. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The written homework #3 is due on <alert>October 30, 2025</alert>.

                    <p>
                        Rather than integrating along the <m>x</m>-axis (which I believe is insanely difficult), try integrating along the <m>y</m>-axis to find the area of the shaded region.

                    <p>
                        To do so, you will need a function <m>x = g(y)</m>... 
                        How do we isolate <m>x</m> in the equation? 
                        You may want to confirm you have the right <em>function</em> by graphing it to see if it matches up with the graph in the figure.

                        Which method, disk or shell, is easier to work with in this problem? 
                        Try sketching out a typical disk (or a typical shell) and make a choice.

                        Which method, disk/washer or shell, is easier to work with in this problem? 
                        <ul marker="">
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    If you pick the disk/washer method, sketch a typical disk/washer and mark its radius/radii.
                                    This will help you determine the radius/radii.

                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    If you pick the shell method, sketch a typical cylindrical shell and mark its radius and height. 
                                    This will help you determine the radius and height. 
                                </p>
