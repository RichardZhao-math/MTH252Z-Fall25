        <p>
            You are encouraged to work on this assignment collaboratively with your peers in class. 
            You can also ask Richard for hints if you are stuck. 
            Yet, you should write up your own work and submit it on Canvas in <alert>one single PDF file</alert>. 
            Show all of your work for full credits, and your work should be clearly written and organized. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The written homework #1 is due on <alert>October 12, 2025</alert>. 
        </p>

                Approximate the area of the region under the curve of <me>y = \frac{4 - x}{1 + x^2}</me> by <alert>calculating the area the area of the shaded rectangles</alert> shown in the diagram below. 
                Which approximation method do these rectangles represent?

                Find <alert>constants</alert> <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> such that

        <hint>
            <p>

            <p>
                Don't try to evaluate <m>\int f(x)\, dx</m> as we need to build up more concepts to be able to evaluate this integral. 
                Instead, take the derivative of <m>F(x)</m> and match it up with <m>f(x)</m>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to find <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> such that <m>F'(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> look <em>exactly</em> the same.

                    f''(x) = x - \cos(x), \qquad f'(0) = 2, \qquad f(0) = -2
