    <title>Approximating Area by Rectangles</title>

    <p>
      If the region under the curve doesn't look like a known geometric figure, then we can't find the area by searching an area formula we learned before. 
      Before thinking about finding the <em>precise</em> area under the curve, let's come up with a method to <alert>approximate</alert> the area. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One tool we have in our toolkit is to split the region into a bunch of rectangular strips and we can approximate the area by summing the area of these rectangular strips.  
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Approximate the area under the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m> using <em>three</em> rectangles in the following steps: 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Graph the function <m>y = f(x)</m> and highlight the region of interest. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Partition the interval <m>[0,3]</m> into <alert>three equal parts</alert>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Construct three rectangles using these parts as the width of the rectangles. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          The first two steps should be straightforward. 
          But how do we determine what the height of each rectangle is... (or does it matter?)
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Let's first graph the function and highlight the region of interest in green. 
        </p>

        <figure>
        <caption>The Graph of <m>y = x^2 + 1</m></caption>
        <image width="50%">
        
          <latex-image >
            \begin{tikzpicture}
              \begin{axis}[
                axis lines=middle,
                xlabel={$x$},
                ylabel={$y$},
                xmin=-0.5, xmax=3.5,
                ymin=-0.5, ymax=10.5,

                minor ytick={1,3,5,7,9},
                samples=100, 
              ]

              % Shaded region under curve y = x^2+1 from 0 to 3
                \addplot [
                  draw=none,
                  fill=green!30,
                  opacity=0.6,
                  domain=0:3
                ] {x^2 + 1} \closedcycle;

              % Graph of the function
                \addplot[blue, ultra thick, smooth, domain=0:3.5] {x^2 + 1};

              % Vertical dashed lines
                \draw[dashed] (axis cs:0, 0) -- (axis cs:0, 1);
                \draw[dashed] (axis cs:3, 0) -- (axis cs:3, 10);

              \end{axis}
            \end{tikzpicture}
          </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>


        <p>
          Now we want to partition <m>[0,3]</m> into <alert>three equal parts</alert>. 
          This implies that the three parts are: <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>[2,3]</m>. 
          Observe that the length of each part is <m>1</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We will next construct three rectangles using these parts as the width. 
          <alert>Then what about the height of each rectangle?</alert> 
        </p>

        <p>
          You can actually pick the height of each rectangle that makes sense. 
          For demonstration purposes, Richard constructed his three rectangles by <em>aligning the upper left corner of each rectangle on the graph</em>.

            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Observe that the area of the orange region is an <em>approximation</em> of the area of the region of interest (the green region). 
          We can actually find the height of each of the three rectangles, which allows us to compute the area of the rectangles. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The height of each rectangle is the <alert>function value</alert> of the left-endpoint of each partition. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, an approximation of the area under the curve, using these three rectangles, is
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{Area} \amp\approx 1\cdot f(0) + 1\cdot f(1) + 1\cdot f(2) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 1\cdot(0^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (1^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (2^2 + 1) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 1 + 2 + 5 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 8 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Observe that this is just an approximation of the area under the curve. This is not the actual area under the curve.</alert>
          We can observe, from the diagram above, that <m>8</m> is an <alert>under-estimate</alert> of the actual area. 
        </p>

      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Observe that Richard made a choice of aligning the <alert>upper left</alert> corner of each rectangle on the curve when he constructed his three rectangles. 
      Let's give this method of approximation a fancy name! 
      This is called the <alert>left-endpoint approximation</alert>. 
      Notationally speaking, we can represent this approximation by <m>L_3</m> (left-endpoint approximation using three rectangles). 
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be wondering if we can align the <em>upper right</em> corner of each rectangle on the curve when you construct the rectangle...
      We certainly can! 
      Let's try the same problem but with a slightly different way of constructing the rectangles! 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Approximate the area under the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m> using <em>three</em> rectangles with equal-width and the <alert>upper right</alert> corner of each rectangle is on the curve. 
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          Diagrams are our friend! 
          Let's graph <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> and construct these three rectangles! 
        </p>

        <p>
          What is the <em>height</em> of each rectangle? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Below is the diagram of three equal-width rectangles and each of the <alert>upper right</alert> corner is on the curve. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Observe that the height of each rectangle is the <alert>function value</alert> of the right-endpoint of each partition. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, an approximation of the area under the curve, using these three rectangles, is
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{Area} \amp\approx 1\cdot f(1) + 1\cdot f(2) + 1\cdot f(3) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 1\cdot (1^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (2^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (3^2 + 1) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 2 + 5 + 10 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 17 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Remember that this is just another approximation of the area under the curve. This is not the actual area under the curve.</alert>
          We can observe, from the diagram above, that <m>17</m> is an <alert>over-estimate</alert> of the actual area. 
        </p>

      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Similarly, we can name this method the <alert>right-endpoint approximation</alert>! 
      Notationally speaking, we can represent this approximation by <m>R_3</m> (right-endpoint approximation using three rectangles). 
    </p>

    <p>
      We can actually make it even more fancier by aligning the <em>midpoint</em> of each rectangle on the curve when you construct the rectangle! 
      There are pros and cons to make the method fancier. 
      Let's try the same problem with this slightly fancier method and see what the pros and cons are! 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Approximate the area under the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m> using <em>three</em> rectangles with equal-width and the <alert>midpoint</alert> of each rectangle is on the curve.
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          Again, diagrams are our friend! Making a pretty diagram will help you determine what the height of each rectangle is so we can compute the area of the rectangles!
        </p>

        <p>
          Observe that the height of each rectangle is the <alert>function value</alert> of the midpoint of each partition. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, an approximation of the area under the curve, using these three rectangles, is
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{Area} \amp\approx 1\cdot f\left(\frac{0 + 1}{2}\right) + 1\cdot f\left(\frac{1 + 2}{2}\right) + 1\cdot f\left(\frac{2 + 3}{2}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 1\cdot (0.5^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (1.5^2 + 1) + 1\cdot (2.5^2 + 1) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 1.25 + 3.25 + 7.25 </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 11.75 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Again, this is just one more approximation of the area under the curve. This is not the actual area under the curve.</alert>
          We actually don't know if this is an under- or over-estimate. 
          Yet, we can observe, from the diagram above, that <m>11.75</m> is a <em>better</em> approximation compared to <m>L_3</m> and <m>R_3</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Again, we can name this even fancier method the <alert>midpoint</alert> approximation! 
      You can imagine that we can represent this approximation by <m>M_3</m> (midpoint approximation using three rectangles). 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can observe that the midpoint approximation will give a <em>better</em> approximation compared to the left- and the right- endpoint approximation (this is a pro). 
      But the tradeoff here is that the height of each rectangle is a bit more complicated to obtain (this is a con). 
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are approximating something, you usually will need to make a choice between <em>computational power</em> and the <em>accuracy of the approximation</em>. 
      Easier methods will give a less-accurate approximation and more-complicated methods will give a more-accurate approximation. 
    </p>
    
    <note>
      <title>Why do I have to approximate the area using rectangles?</title>
      
      <p>
        You may have an even better way of approximating the area if you are not using rectangles. 
        As an example, you may want to approximate the area using <em>trapezoids</em> as follows: 
      </p>

      <p>
        This approximation seems to give us an even better approximation... 
        So <alert>why using rectangles at all</alert>? 
      </p>

      <p>
        This goes back to the idea of choosing between <em>computational power</em> and <em>accuracy of the approximation</em>.
        The reason why Richard wanted you to approximate the area using rectangles in this section is because <alert>we can find the area of a rectangle easily</alert> 
        (so Richard picked the <em>computational power</em> over the <em>accuracy of approximation</em> so far, of course, for a good reason).
      </p>

      <p>
        You are more than welcome to approximate the area using other shapes other than rectangles. 
        This is just a preview that we will approximate the area using <em>trapezoids</em> and even <em>parabolas</em> in section 7.8. 
      </p>

        <p>
          Remember that diagrams are our friends! 
          In addition, let's see if we can come up with some formulas to compute these approximations so we don't have to graph the function each time.

          We want six rectangles with equal widths so we want to split <m>[1,3]</m> into six equal parts.

            N = 6

        <p>
          Next, we want to find out the length of each part, aka the width of each rectangle. 
          If we call this number <m>\Delta x</m>, then we know that

        <p>
          This will allow us to figure out exactly each parts of the partitions.

    <p>
      Let's generalize the process! 
      Let's say we want to approximate the area under the graph of <m>y= f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> using <m>N</m> equal-width rectangles. 
      Then the width of each rectangle is 
      <me>
        \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{N}
      </me>
      Furthermore, let's index our <m>x</m>'s such that <m>a = x_0</m> and <m>b = x_N</m>. 
      Then we can approximate the area under the curve as follows: 
      <me>
        L_N = \Delta x\bigg(f\left(x_0\right) + f\left(x_1\right) + f\left(x_2\right) + \cdots + f\left(x_{N-1}\right)\bigg)
      </me>
      <me>
        R_N = \Delta x\bigg(f\left(x_1\right) + f\left(x_2\right) + f\left(x_3\right) + \cdots + f\left(x_N\right)\bigg)
      </me>
      <me>
        M_N = \Delta x\bigg(f\left(\frac{x_0 + x_1}{2}\right) + f\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right) + \cdots + f\left(\frac{x_{N-1} +x_N}{2}\right)\bigg)
      </me>
      We can approximate the area once we can partition the interval and figure out the values of all the <m>x_i</m>'s, where <m>i</m> is the index. 
      Then we don't have to graph the functions and construct all the rectangles.

  <p>
    You may get the feeling that there is a pattern in the formulas above.  
    We are adding similar things together. 
    Sometimes it is kind of tedious to write out all the addends when the addends are similar with a pattern. 
    Actually we have a special notation in math we can use to add things up with a pattern. 
    <definition xml:id="def-SummationNotation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sum</term> of numbers <m>a_m, \ldots, a_n</m> (<m>m\leq n</m>) is denoted 
          <me>
            \sum_{i = m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m + 1} + a_{m + 2} + \cdots + a_n
          </me>
          where the greek letter <m>\Sigma</m> (capital sigma) stands for the <term>sum</term>. 
          <m>i</m> denotes the index, the <m>i = m</m> below the <m>\Sigma</m> denotes the starting value of <m>m</m>, and the <m>n</m> above the <m>\Sigma</m> denotes the index ends at <m>n</m>.

      Expand the summation notation <m>\displaystyle \sum_{i = 0}^5 i(i - 1)</m>. 
      Then evaluate this expression.

    <hint>
      <p>
        Recall the <m>\Sigma</m> notation represents the sum.

        Furthermore, we know the value of <m>i</m> is the index that starts at <m>0</m> and ends at <m>5</m>... 
      </p>
    </hint>

    <solution>
      <p>
        We will add all the <m>i(i - 1)</m>'s together where <m>i</m> starts at <m>0</m> and ends at <m>5</m>. 
        Hence, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>\sum_{i = 0}^5 i(i - 1) \amp= 0(0-1) + 1(1-1) + 2(2-1) + 3(3-1) + 4(4-1) + 5(5-1) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 12 + 20 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= 40 </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Using the summation notation, we can rewrite the formulas for <m>L_N</m>, <m>R_N</m>, and <m>M_N</m> more briefly. 
    <me>
      L_N = \Delta x \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1} f\left(x_i\right)
    </me>
    <me>
      R_N = \Delta x \sum_{i = 1}^N f\left(x_i\right)
    </me>
    <me>
      M_N = \Delta x \sum_{i = 0}^{N-1} f\left(\frac{x_i + x_{i + 1}}{2}\right)
    </me>

  <title>Computing Area as the Limit of Approximation</title>
  
  <p>
    Now that we know how to approximate the area under the curve using rectangles. 
    Then the next question here is how to make our approximation better and better.
