    <title>Something to ponder on... </title>
    
    <p>
      Notice that the FTC, part I, has an assumption that says <m>f</m> is <alert>continuous</alert> on some <alert>closed</alert> interval <m>[a,b]</m>. 
      Later in the class (likely towards the end of <xref ref="ch7-TechniquesIntegration"/>), Richard will make a BIG deal of this assumption (so he is cool if you don't pay attention to it now). 
      But why is this assumption necessary? 
    </p>

    <p>
      To give you an actual problem to think about, is it correct to evaluate the integral as follows? 
      <me>
        \int_{-1}^3 \frac{1}{x^2}\, dx = -\frac{1}{x}\bigg|_{-1}^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{-1}\right) = -\frac{4}{3}
      </me>
      We will revisit this problem in <xref ref="sec77-ImproperIntegral"/> and point out what's wrong with this line of work.
